            <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>

            <h2>Purpose</h2>

            <p>
                SeaPHP UG desires to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors as possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all, regardless of their professional or personal background including education, experience, age, ability, gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, disability, physical appearance, or religion. We invite all those who participate in SeaPHP UG to help us in creating such an environment.
            </p>
            <p>
                This Code of Conduct (CoC) outlines the expectations of all who participate in our group, as well as how we should respond to unacceptable behavior. We expect participants will abide by this CoC in all community venues—whether online or in-person—as well as in one-on-one communications as they pertain to group business.
            </p>

            <h2>Expectations</h2>

            <p>
                You are expected to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Behave professionally.</li>
                <li>Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.</li>
                <li>Attempt collaboration before conflict.</li>
                <li>Refrain from any unacceptable behavior.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Unacceptable behaviors include: intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory, or demeaning speech or actions by any participant in our group. Community event venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.
            </p>
            <p>
                Harassment includes: harmful or prejudicial verbal or written comments related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, disability; inappropriate use of nudity and/or sexual images in public spaces (including presentation slides); deliberate intimidation, stalking or following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome sexual attention.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our expectation is that we will treat each other, and others our community interacts with, with consideration, empathy, and respect. Our speech and behavior will be guided by a desire to create and maintain an inclusive community purposed towards sharing knowledge and encouraging enthusiasm for solving problems with PHP.
            </p>

            <h2>Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior</h2>
            <p>
                Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event).
            </p>

            <h2>Complaints</h2>
            <p>
                It is every community member's responsibility to notice, and attempt to intervene or notify others, if unacceptable behaviors are occurring at a meeting or event.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a community organizer as soon as possible. You can contact the organizers at admins@seaphp.com, send a direct message to @seaphp on twitter, or speak to an organizer in person at an event.
            </p>
            <p>
                The current organizers are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ian Maddox (@isNoOp)</li>
                <li>Jeremy Lindblom (@jeremeamia)</li>
                <li>Joel Simpson (@JoelRSimpson)</li>
                <li>Tessa Mero (@TessaMero)</li>
                <li>Dan Munro (@danielmunro)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                If you have a complaint that involves an organizer, you can contact one of the others in confidence. The group is the priority, and steps will be taken to ensure the group is successful.
